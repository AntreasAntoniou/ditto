#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# setup-signing.sh — one-time, USER-RUN setup of a stable local code-signing identity.
#
# WHY: build-app.sh ad-hoc signs by default, which mints a NEW code identity on
# every rebuild. macOS keys the Accessibility (AX) grant to code identity, so the
# auto-paste ⌘V permission is silently forgotten on each rebuild. A stable,
# self-signed identity gives the app a constant code identity → the AX grant
# survives rebuilds.
#
# ⚠️  THIS SCRIPT MODIFIES YOUR LOGIN KEYCHAIN.
#     It creates a self-signed code-signing certificate named "Ditto Local Signing"
#     and imports it (private key + cert) into your login keychain. macOS MAY PROMPT
#     YOU FOR YOUR LOGIN PASSWORD one or more times to authorize this. The identity
#     is local-only, self-signed, and used solely to sign your local Ditto.app build.
#     It is NOT a trusted/Apple-issued certificate and cannot sign for distribution.
#
# Idempotent: if the identity already exists it does nothing and exits 0.
# Safe to re-run.
